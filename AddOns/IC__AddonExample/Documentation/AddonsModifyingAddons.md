# **Modifying GUI of other tabs/addons.**

To add button or text or other control to another addon's tab:
* Set the tab you want to get the control from.. get the location of some control with a variable name. 
* Update your variables to allow you to set some relative distance to the control. 
* Add the new control at that location

See the example [ServerCall GUI](./../Example_ServerCall/Example_ServerCall_GUI.ahk) to see sample code demonstrating adding text and a button to the example addon's tab.

# Script Hub Settings File
## Description:
These are the currently available advanced settings in Settings.json.

## Advanced Settings: 

* **NoCtrlKeypress**: 0 / 1 (Default: 0)
If this is set to 1, ctrl keypresses will not be used for functions within IC_SharedFunctions_Class. (e.g. in InitZone when leveling click damage.)

* **WaitForProcessTime**: 0+  (Default: 0)
Time in milliseconds the script will wait after running the game. Increasing this value is a workaround for the process ID changing using the Kartridge client.

* **WindowXPosition**: 0+ (Default: 0)
This option allows you to set where Script Hub will appear horizontally across your screen. 0 is default and is the far left of the screen.

* **WindowYPosition**: 0+ (Default: 0)
This option allows you to set where Script Hub will appear vertically on your screen. 0 is default and is the very top of the screen.

* **WindowTitle**: \<string\> (Default: "")  
Adds a custom text to the window title. Useful when running multiple copies of IC Script Hub to differentiate them.
